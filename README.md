Identifying Essential Hub Genes and Protein Complexes in Malaria GO Data using Semantic Similarity Measures

Hub genes play an essential role in biological systems because of their interaction with other genes. A vocabulary used in bioinformatics called Gene Ontology (GO) describes how genes and proteins operate. This flexible ontology illustrates the operation of molecular, biological, and cellular processes (Pmol, Pbio, Pcel). Various methodologies can be analyzed to determine semantic similarity. Research in this study, we employ the jack-knife method by taking into account 4 well-liked Semantic similarity measures namely Jaccard similarity, Cosine similarity, Pairwise document similarity, and Levenshtein distance. Based on these similarity values, the protein-protein interaction network (PPI) of Malaria GO (Gene Ontology) data is built, which causes clusters of identical or related protein complexes (Px) to form. The hub nodes of the network are these necessary proteins. We use a variety of centrality measures to establish clusters of these networks to determine which node is the most important. The clusters' unique formation makes it simple to determine which class of Px they are allied to.
